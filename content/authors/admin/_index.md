Ziqiang Xu is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of System Cybernetics at Hiroshima University. He focuses on the autonomic nervous system and develops biomedical signal processing techniques to sense its activity in a non-invasive way for clinical diagnostic support and daily healthcare. He is also a member of the Biological Systems Engineering Lab at Hiroshima University, which works on biological signal analysis and its applications in human interfaces, medical devices, etc.

Xu received his M.Eng. degree in Pattern Recognition & Intelligent System in 2019 from University of Science and Technology of China. From 2019 to present, Xu conducts research at Hiroshima University, developing techniques to evaluate sympathetic responsiveness of the cardiovascular system and thereby monitor sympathetic nervous system activity. Xu is currently developing techniques to restore sympathetic nervous system activity from cardiovascular markers for precise clinical diagnosis.
